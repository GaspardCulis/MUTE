# Minecraft Update Title Editor

The Web port of [MinecraftTitleGenerator](https://github.com/ewanhowell5195/MinecraftTitleGenerator) made with the [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) framework, in 1 week.

## Adding new fonts/textures

This project being based on Ewanhowell's Minecraft Title Generator, if you wish to add new fonts or textures, follow the [submission intructions](https://github.com/ewanhowell5195/MinecraftTitleGenerator?tab=readme-ov-file#submissions) on his repository, and I'll update my website submodule whenever his repository gets new additions.
